Ans- Semantic tags in HTML are elements that convey meaning and define the structure of web content. Examples include <header>, <nav>, <article>, and <footer>. They improve accessibility, search engine optimization, and facilitate easier understanding and maintenance of web pages by both humans and machines.

Q.3 Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements? 


Ans- HTML Tags: Tags are the markup symbols used in HTML to define the structure and elements of a web page. They are represented by angle brackets (<>), and usually, they come in pairs - an opening tag and a closing tag. For example: <p> is an opening tag, and </p> is a closing tag.

HTML Elements: Elements are made up of HTML tags, along with the content they enclose. An HTML element consists of the opening tag, the content (text or other elements), and the closing tag. For example: <p>Hello, this is a paragraph.</p> is an HTML element where <p> and </p> are the tags, and "Hello, this is a paragraph." is the content.

In summary, tags are the individual markup symbols used in HTML, while elements are complete structures made up of tags and their enclosed content. Elements are what give meaning and structure to a web page.
