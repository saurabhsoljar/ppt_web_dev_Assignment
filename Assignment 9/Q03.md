Q.3 How to pass data from one component to another component?+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ans:To pass data from one component to another in React, we can use props. 

In the parent component, we can pass the data as a prop when rendering the child component. For example, `<ChildComponent data={myData} />`. 

In the child component, we can access the data by using the prop name. For example, `props.data`. 

This allows us to pass data from the parent component to the child component, enabling communication and sharing of information between components.
