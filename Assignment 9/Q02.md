Q.2 Explain useState Hook & what can you achieve with it?+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ans: The useState hook in React is a powerful feature that allows functional components to have their own state. It is used to declare state variables and provides a way to access and update them. The useState hook takes an initial value as an argument and returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that value. By calling the update function, you can modify the state, triggering a re-render of the component. This enables you to create dynamic and interactive components without the need for class components or lifecycle methods.
