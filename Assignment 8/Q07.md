Q.7 Explain Prop Drilling in React & Ways to avoid it.+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ans: Prop drilling occurs when data is passed from a component through multiple levels of nested components, even if the intermediate components don't need the data.Prop drilling is a situation where data is passed from one component through multiple interdependent components until you get to the component where the data is needed.

To avoid prop drilling:
- Use React's Context API to provide data directly to components without explicit prop passing.
- Utilize state management libraries like React Redux to centralize and share data across components.
- Implement Higher-Order Components (HOCs) to encapsulate common logic and pass data down to components without prop drilling.
- Utilize React Hooks, such as useState and useContext, to manage state and share data within functional components.
- Consider component composition to directly connect or wrap components together that need shared data, avoiding unnecessary prop passing.
