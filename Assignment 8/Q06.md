Q.6 Explain react component life cycle.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ans:In ReactJS, every component creation process involves various lifecycle methods. These lifecycle methods are termed as component's lifecycle. 

1. Initial Phase:
- Component is created and initialized.
- State and event handlers are set up in the constructor() method.

2. Mounting Phase:
- Component is rendered and inserted into the DOM.
- JSX markup is generated in the render() method.
- componentDidMount() is called after rendering, used for additional setup tasks.

3. Updating Phase:
- Occurs when component's props or state change.
- componentDidUpdate() is called after updates are reflected in the DOM.
- shouldComponentUpdate() determines if the component should re-render, optimizing   performance.

4. Unmounting Phase:
- Component is being removed from the DOM.
- componentWillUnmount() is called before unmounting, used for cleanup tasks.
