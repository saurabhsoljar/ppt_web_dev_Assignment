Q.4 Whats component? Types of component.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ans:In React, a component is a reusable and self-contained building block that encapsulates a piece of user interface (UI) and its related logic. Components can be thought of as custom HTML elements with their own properties and behavior.
Class Component

A class component must include the extends React.Component statement. This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.
The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.
Example--
class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}

Function Component
A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a Class component, but Function components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand, and will be preferred in this tutorial.

function Car() {
  return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
}
