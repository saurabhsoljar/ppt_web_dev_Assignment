Q.2 What do you understand by Virtual Dom?++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ans: The Virtual DOM is a technique used by React to optimize the updating and rendering process of web applications. It is a virtual representation of the actual DOM. When changes occur in the application's state, React compares the previous Virtual DOM with the updated one to determine the specific changes that need to be made in the actual DOM. By minimizing direct manipulation of the real DOM, React improves performance and rendering speed. Essentially, the Virtual DOM acts as a lightweight copy that allows React to efficiently update and render components, resulting in a more responsive user interface.
