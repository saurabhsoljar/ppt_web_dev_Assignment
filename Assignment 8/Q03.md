Q.3 Difference between Virtual Dom vs Real Dom.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ans: Virtual DOM provides a more efficient and optimized way of updating and rendering web applications compared to the direct manipulation of the real DOM.

The Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM used by libraries like React. It allows for efficient updates by comparing the previous and updated versions and applying only the necessary changes to the real DOM. This approach reduces the need to manipulate the entire DOM tree, resulting in improved performance and faster rendering. In contrast, the real DOM is the browser's native representation of the HTML structure and requires rendering the entire affected subtree even for small changes. By using the Virtual DOM, React optimizes the update process, making applications more responsive and improving the overall user experience compared to direct manipulation of the real DOM.
