Q.1 What is a Media Query in CSS, and what is its purpose?

The CSS Media Query gives you a way to apply CSS only when the browser and device environment matches a rule that you specify, for example "viewport is wider than 480 pixels". Media queries are a key part of responsive web design, as they allow you to create different layouts depending on the size of the viewport, but they can also be used to detect other things about the environment your site is running on, for example whether the user is using a touchscreen rather than a mouse. In this lesson you will first learn about the syntax used in media queries, and then move on to use them in a working example showing how a simple design might be made responsive.

@media media-type and (media-feature-rule) {
  /* CSS rules go here */
}



Q.2 How do you define a media query in CSS?

Media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to different devices. To demonstrate a simple example, we can change the background color for different devices:


/* Set the background color of body to tan */
body {
  background-color: tan;
}

/* On screens that are 992px or less, set the background color to blue */
@media screen and (max-width: 992px) {
  body {
    background-color: blue;
  }
}

/* On screens that are 600px or less, set the background color to olive */
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: olive;
  }
}




Q.3 Explain the concept of Breakpoints in Responsive Web Design and How They are used in Media Queries.

Breakpoints are the building blocks of responsive design. They are used to control when your layout can be adapted at a particular viewport or device size. Media query breakpoints are used to control when your layout can be adapted at a particular viewport or device size. Some common media query breakpoints include:

320px for most smartphones in portrait mode
480px for larger smartphones and smaller tablets in portrait mode
768px for most tablets in portrait mode and some laptops in landscape mode
1024px for most laptops and desktops in landscape mode
1280px for larger desktops and monitors in landscape mode



Q.4 What is the purpose of using Media Queries for Print Media?

Webpages can be printed, but you probably knew that already. You probably don't do it very often, because…well, they're often ugly, too long, or a complete mess. But what you might not have known, is that we can define separate CSS styles using media queries for webpages that translate to a Letter or A4 document.

Websites that sells tickets do this often (think: boarding passes, entrance tickets, proof of purchase, invoices, et cetera), but it's not the norm for everyday content, which is a shame because users do attempt to make content available offline more than you think (i.e. before a flight, as a printable reference, et cetera).



Step 1: CSS Media Queries for Print
First of all, we define the media query:

@media print {
    /* styles here */
}

Assuming that this appears at the bottom of your CSS stylesheet, most styles within the media query for print should overwrite anything else that exists with ease.

If not, try using the !important rule.



Step 2: Hiding Redundancy
When downloading webpages as PDF, users don't need:

UI elements
Header/footer
Sidebar content
Forms and CTAs
Et cetera
We need to hide those elements using display:none;.

Our code then becomes (as an example):

@media print {
    header, footer, aside, form, … {
        display: none;
    }
}


Not bad, but there's some unwanted spacing at the top.

We'll want to "reset" this spacing, which won't necessarily be on the <body> tag. In my case it was a margin: on the <article> element, hence:

@media print {
  header, footer, aside, form, … {
    display: none;
  }
  article {
    width:100%!important;
    padding:0!important;
    margin:0!important;
  }
}



Step 3: Customizing Page Margins
Browsers are actually quite efficient when it comes to redefining page margins and stacking content. That being said, you might want to define your own margins, which is reasonably easy to do. Just remember to use cm instead of px!

Our code then becomes:

@media print {
  header, footer, aside, form, … {
    display: none;
  }
  article {
    width:100%!important;
    padding:0!important;
    margin:0!important;
  }
}
@page {
  margin: 2cm;
}
As you can see from the code example above, margins are defined using the @page at-rule, not by adding margins to the <body> element, since the <body> only exists once and spans the height of all the pages collectively. With this declarative we can even define separate margins for first, last, left and right pages (in the event that said exportable spans more than a singular page), for example:

@page:first {
    margin: 0cm;
}
@page:last {
    margin: 5cm;
}
@page:left {
    margin: 2cm 1.5cm 2cm 2cm;
}
@page:right {
    margin: 2cm 2cm 2cm 1.5cm;
}


Step 4: Handling Links
Links are still clickable in PDFs, but for those users that might want to physically hold the content, we'll need to come up with something more creative. It was Ben Frain that originally enlightened me of this really simple, super-cool trick.

@media print {
  a:after {
    content: "("attr(href)")";
  }
}
